## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this (do I want my output to show this code? do I want the reader to see the code?)

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# My header

Some text

Some *italic text*

Some **bold text**

-   Eggs
-   Milk

```{r}
x <- 3
x
```
